# Git History Security Audit - Summary

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

This repository's git history contains **compromised secrets and API keys** that need immediate attention.

## Quick Summary

**Status**: ⚠️ SECRETS FOUND IN HISTORY  
**Date Audited**: 2026-02-13  
**Commits Analyzed**: 34  
**High Risk Findings**: 4  
**Medium Risk Findings**: 2

## What Was Found

### 1. ✅ Current Code Status (SECURE)
- All secrets properly use environment variables
- `.gitignore` correctly excludes `.env` files  
- GitHub Actions uses repository secrets
- No hardcoded secrets in current codebase

### 2. ⚠️ Historical Issues (COMPROMISED)

The following commits show evidence of secrets being committed:

1. **`.env` files were committed** (Dec 2025)
   - `frontend/.env.development` was tracked and contained secrets
   - Attempts were made to remove it, but it remains in git history
   - File contained: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `VITE_API_TOKEN`

2. **"add api token" commit** (Nov 2025)
   - Commit `649729a2` modified authentication code with message "add api token"
   - Suggests a token may have been hardcoded initially

3. **Environment variables moved** (Nov 2025)
   - Commit `3787eafe` with message "env variables pulled out"
   - Indicates secrets were previously hardcoded in Python files

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Must Do Now:
1. **Rotate the API_TOKEN** - Consider it compromised
2. **Review AWS credentials** - Check if they were in committed .env files
3. **Check these specific commits** on GitHub:
   - `649729a2e3ec3ffb326c80827ee9b0a7e644f701` - view the actual token that was added
   - `938d042ee3b9896f7b3da6db5b344ebbeb67e5a7` - view what was in .env.development

### Should Do Soon:
1. Enable GitHub Secret Scanning (Advanced Security)
2. Consider rewriting git history with BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. Install pre-commit hooks (git-secrets or similar)
4. Add automated secret scanning to CI/CD
